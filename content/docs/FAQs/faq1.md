**It's a fair question.**

More than anything, **I'm a writer**. I use words to help people make sense of things. That shows up in different ways, depending on the needs of the organization I'm writing for:

- I create clear, concise documentation. That means user manuals. It means FAQs and knowledge base content.
- I write UI copy that helps people accomplish their goals.

In addition to writing, I use **design skills** to make content easy to consume.

- I create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to help designers develop product concepts.
- I make documents look great so users enjoy reading them.
