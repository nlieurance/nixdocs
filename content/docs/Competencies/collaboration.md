**Is there anything more important?**

Working with cross-functional stakeholders is a key part of what I do. I have extensive experience collaborating with:
- Designers
- Engineers
- Product managers
- Product marketers
- Salespeople
- Support reps

## An example
As SurveyMonkey got closer and closer to finishing development for [Build with AI](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/build-with-ai/), we needed to choose a feature name. I organized a cross-functional workshop with people from design, engineering, marketing, product management, and support teams. We aligned on naming criteria, brainstormed, and chose three of our favorite potential names. Then I presented those three names to 200 people in a name-test survey. I shared the winner with stakeholdersâ€”Build with AI. We all agreed to call the feature by that name. Now it's the #1 way new users create SurveyMonkey surveys.
