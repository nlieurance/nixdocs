**I can code! Amazing, right?**

OK, maybe it's not amazing. I'm no software engineer or professional developer. But I know my way around data structures, conditional statements, loops, and functions. Here are the details:

## HTML/CSS
I was in college when I first learned to use HTML and CSS. How long ago was that? None of your business! But Flash was super popular. Every website you went to had an intro page where you could choose to visit the Flash site or the static site. And I took my college's first web design class, where we may have used Dreamweaver at some point.

## Markdown
I used Markdown to create all the content for this site. Then I turned it into HTML with Hugo, a [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator). Markdown is my go-to when I need to take notes or document something. I've written Markdown in Obsidian, Confluence, and other tools.

## Python
In 2014, I was the foreman at a cabinet shop in Colorado. To demonstrate the efficiency of a manufacturing process I wanted to use, I built this software simulation. From scratch. With Python and Tkinter. I'm not sure why I thought I'd be able to pull it off. But I did.

## PHP/MySQL

CabinetQuote is a CRUD app I built back in 2015. It was a hobby project, although I did entertain ideas of taking it to market. Here are some of the important features I was able to build:
- Authentication: Create an account with a username and password. CabinetQuote checks for those credentials when you attemtp to log in later. 
- Content creation: Want to post a project so contractors can submit quotes? That's what CQ is all about. Add a photo or a link to an inspiring project on Pinterest.
- Viewing and filtering: When viewing projects on the homepage, you can filter by country, state, and city.
- Pagination: Projects appear in batches of 10 per page so you don't get overwhelmed.
- Updating: Edit the details of your project anytime.
- Messaging: Leave a message for a contractor who gives you a quote. Chat back and forth.
- Deleting: Don't need to hire a contractor anymore? Remove your project from CabinetQuote.
- Error handling: Oops! Did you enter the wrong password or type soma letter where you should've typed a number? That's OK. CabinetQuote won't break.
- Security: CabinetQuote sanitizes input before adding it to the database and encrypts passwords.
